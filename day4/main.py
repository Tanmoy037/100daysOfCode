# Instructions
# You are going to write a virtual coin toss program. It will randomly tell the user "Heads" or "Tails".

# Important, the first letter should be capitalised and spelt exactly like in the example e.g. Heads, not heads.

# There are many ways of doing this. But to practice what we learnt in the last lesson, you should generate a random number, either 0 or 1. Then use that number to print out Heads or Tails.

# e.g. 1 means Heads 0 means Tails

# Example Output
# Heads
# or

# Tails

#Remember to use the random module
#Hint: Remember to import the random module here at the top of the file. 🎲
	 
#Write the rest of your code below this line 👇
import random
random_number = random.randint(0,1)

if random_number == 0:
    print("Tails")
else:
    print("Heads")




# Instructions
# You are going to write a program that will select a random name from a list of names. The person selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill.

# Important: You are not allowed to use the choice() function.

# Line 8 splits the string names_string into individual names and puts them inside a List called names. For this to work, you must enter all the names as names followed by comma then space. e.g. name, name, name

# Example Input
# Angela, Ben, Jenny, Michael, Chloe
# Note: notice that there is a space between the comma and the next name.

# Example Output
# Michael is going to buy the meal today!


# Import the random module here

# Split string method
names_string = input("Give me everybody's names, separated by a comma. ")
names = names_string.split(", ")
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

#Write your code below this line 👇

import random

pic_names = len(names)

random_items = random.randint(0, pic_names - 1)

who_will_pay = names[random_items]

print(who_will_pay + " is going to buy the meal today!")



# Instructions
# You are going to write a program that will mark a spot with an X.

# In the starting code, you will find a variable called map.

# This map contains a nested list. When map is printed this is what the nested list looks like:

# [['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']]

# This is a bit hard to work with. So on lines 6 and 23, we've used this line of code print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}" to format the 3 lists to be printed as a 3 by 3 square, each on a new line. 

# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

# Now it looks a bit more like the coordinates of a real map:



# Your job is to write a program that allows you to mark a square on the map using a two-digit system. 

# The first digit in the input will specify the column (the position on the horizontal axis).

# The second digit in the input will specify the row number (the position on the vertical axis). 

# So an input of 23 should place an X at the position shown below:



# First, your program must take the user input and convert it to a usable format.

# Next, you need to use that input to update your nested list with an "x". Remember that your nested list map actually looks like this: [['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']].

# Example Input 1
# column 2, row 3 would be entered as:

# 23
# Example Output 1
# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
# ['⬜️', 'X', '⬜️']
# Example Input 2
# column 3, row 1 would be entered as:

# 31
# Example Output 2
# ['⬜️', '⬜️', 'X']
# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']




# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
row1 = ["⬜️","️⬜️","️⬜️"]
row2 = ["⬜️","⬜️","️⬜️"]
row3 = ["⬜️️","⬜️️","⬜️️"]
map = [row1, row2, row3]
print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}")
position = input("Where do you want to put the treasure? ")
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

#Write your code below this row 👇
horizonal = int (position[0])
vertical = int (position[1])



#Write your code above this row 👆
map [vertical - 1] [horizonal - 1] = "X"

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}")






# Rock Paper Scissors game





import random

user_choice = input("What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper or 2 for Scissors.\n")

computer_choice = random.randint(0,2)
print(f"computer chose {computer_choice}")

if user_choice >= 3 or user_choice < 0:
    print("You typed an invalid number. You lose!")
elif user_choice == 0 and computer_choice == 2:
    print("You win!")
elif computer_choice == 0 and user_choice == 2:
    print("You lose!")
elif computer_choice > user_choice:
    print("You lose!")
elif user_choice > computer_choice:
    print("You win!")
elif user_choice == computer_choice:
    print("It's a draw!")
