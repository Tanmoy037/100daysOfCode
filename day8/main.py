# Instructions
# You are painting a wall. The instructions on the paint can says that 1 can of paint can cover 5 square meters of wall. Given a random height and width of wall, calculate how many cans of paint you'll need to buy.

# number of cans = (wall height x wall width) Ã· coverage per can.

# e.g. Height = 2, Width = 4, Coverage = 5

# number of cans = (2 * 4) / 5

#                            = 1.6

# But because you can't buy 0.6 of a can of paint, the result should be rounded up to 2 cans.

# IMPORTANT: Notice the name of the function and parameters must match those on line 13 for the code to work.

# Example Input
# test_h = 3
# test_w = 9
# Example Output
# You'll need 6 cans of paint.
