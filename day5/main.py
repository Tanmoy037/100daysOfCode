# Instructions
# You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.

# e.g. student_heights = [180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146]

# The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights.

# e.g.

# 180 + 124 + 165 + 173 + 189 + 169 + 146 = 1146

# There are a total of 7 heights in student_heights

# 1146 Ã· 7 = 163.71428571428572

# Average height rounded to the nearest whole number = 164

# Important You should not use the sum() or len() functions in your answer. You should try to replicate their functionality using what you have learnt about for loops.

# Example Input
# 156 178 165 171 187
# In this case, student_heights would be a list that looks like: [156, 178, 165, 171, 187]

# Example Output
# 171


# using for loop 

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
student_heights = input("Input a list of student heights ").split()
for n in range(0, len(student_heights)):
  student_heights[n] = int(student_heights[n])
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†


#Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡
total_student = 0
count = 0
for student in student_heights:
    total_student += student 
    count += 1
print (round(total_student/count))


# Instructions
# You are going to write a program that calculates the highest score from a List of scores.

# e.g. student_scores = [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]

# Important you are not allowed to use the max or min functions. The output words must match the example. i.e

# The highest score in the class is: x

# Example Input
# 78 65 89 86 55 91 64 89
# In this case, student_scores would be a list that looks like: [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]

# Example Output
# The highest score in the class is: 91



# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
student_scores = input("Input a list of student scores ").split()
for n in range(0, len(student_scores)):
  student_scores[n] = int(student_scores[n])
print(student_scores)
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡

highest_score = 0
for score in student_scores:
    if score > highest_score:
        highest_score = score
print (f"The highest score in the class is: {highest_score}")




# Instructions
# You are going to write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game.

# Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.

# When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".

# When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".`

#   And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"

# e.g. it might start off like this:

# 1
# 2
# Fizz
# 4
# Buzz
# Fizz
# 7
# 8
# Fizz
# Buzz
# 11
# Fizz
# 13
# 14
# FizzBuzz


#Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡

for i in range(1, 16):
    if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
        print("fizz buzz")
    elif i % 3 == 0:
        print("fizz")
    elif i % 5 == 0:
        print("buzz")
    else:
        print(i)
