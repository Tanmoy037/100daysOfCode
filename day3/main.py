# Instructions
# Congratulations, you've got a job at Python Pizza. Your first job is to build an automatic pizza order program.

# Based on a user's order, work out their final bill.

# Small Pizza: $15

# Medium Pizza: $20

# Large Pizza: $25

# Pepperoni for Small Pizza: +$2

# Pepperoni for Medium or Large Pizza: +$3

# Extra cheese for any size pizza: + $1

# Example Input
# size = "L"
# add_pepperoni = "Y"
# extra_cheese = "N"
# Example Output
# Your final bill is: $28.

# 💪 This is a Difficult Challenge 💪
# Instructions
# You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people.

# To work out the love score between two people:

# Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs. 

# Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs. 

# Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.

# For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be:

# "Your score is **x**, you go together like coke and mentos."
# For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:

# "Your score is **y**, you are alright together."
# Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:

# "Your score is **z**."
# e.g.

# name1 = "Angela Yu"
# name2 = "Jack Bauer"
# T occurs 0 times

# R occurs 1 time

# U occurs 2 times

# E occurs 2 times

# Total = 5

# L occurs 1 time

# O occurs 0 times

# V occurs 0 times

# E occurs 2 times

# Total = 3

# Love Score = 53

# Print: "Your score is 53."

# Example Input 1
# name1 = "Kanye West"
# name2 = "Kim Kardashian"
# Example Output 1
# Your score is 42, you are alright together.
# Example Input 2
# name1 = "Brad Pitt"
# name2 = "Jennifer Aniston"
# Example Output 2
# Your score is 73.

print("Welcome to the Love Calculator!")
name1 = input("What is your name? \n")
name2 = input("What is their name? \n")

combine_string = name1 + name2
lower_case_string = combine_string.lower()

t = lower_case_string.count("t")
r = lower_case_string.count("r")
u = lower_case_string.count("u")
e = lower_case_string.count("e")

true = t + r + u + e

l = lower_case_string.count("l")
o = lower_case_string.count("o")
v = lower_case_string.count("v")
e = lower_case_string.count("e")

love = l + o + v + e

love_score = int(str(true) + str(love))

if (love_score < 10) or (love_score > 90):
    print(f"Your love score is {love_score}, you go together like coke and mentos.")
elif (love_score >= 40) and (love_score < 50):
    print(f"Your score is {love_score}, you are alright together.")
else:
    print(f"Your score is {love_score}.")
